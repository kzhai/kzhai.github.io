\section{\centerline{PROFESSIONAL CONTRIBUTION}}
\vspace{0.1in}
Online released code-base on \url{github.com/kzhai}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Activate contributor for MapReduce library Cloud$^9$ and Hadoop toolkit Ivory.
\item MapReduce latent Dirichlet allocation (Variational Beyesian
  inference, with extension to informed prior and polylingual LDA).
  \begin{quotation}
    % The second comes out of the Cloud Computing Research Team based in the University of Maryland and is named Mr. LDA. \ldots 
    ``I tried both and found that, despite \emph{Mr. LDA}'s cringeworthy name, it's much faster than \emph{Mahout}'s implementation so decided to go with that one.''\\

\item Latent Dirichlet allocation (Gibbs sampling, variational Bayesian inference and online version).
\item Non-parametric Bayesian models (Indian buffet process, hierarchical Dirichlet process and infinite Gaussian mixture model).
\item Customizable deep learning toolkits using Theano and PyTorch.
\end{itemize}
